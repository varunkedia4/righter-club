                            <li>The customer selects the fabric & design from the catalogue on the website.</li>
                            <li>After selection, the customer chooses if they wants the outfit in the standard size or prefers to get the measurement done at their place.</li>
                            <li>The measurement is scheduled within 2-3 days unless otherwise requested by the customer.</li>
                            <li>Post the body measurement, the stitched outfit in the right size is delivered to the customer and the payment is taken.</li>
